# psInlineProgress

This module exposes just one function; Write-InlineProgress, which lets you write inline progress bars in PowerShell.

## Installation

If you have PowerShellGet, you can install it with:

    Install-Module psInlineProgress

Else, you would have to download the zip from this repository and manually unpack it to one of the module paths on your system.
